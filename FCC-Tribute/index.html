    <h2 id="tribute-info">This is a description of the vital history of Chamoy:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Chamoy is the juice from the fruit on the Tree of Knowledge in the Garden of Good and Evil</li>
      <li>It was discovered by Portuguese missionaries in the 15th century</li>
      <li>Franciscan monks thought it to be of divine origin and would use it as a salve on wounds</li>
      <li>In the late 19th century, an entrepreneurial carnival performer saw the potential of the substance's sweetness to distract children</li>
      <li>Today, all children in San Antonio, TX are baptized with chamoy on their 6th birthday</li>
      <li>Y'all are probably already familiar with mangos</li>
      </ul>
